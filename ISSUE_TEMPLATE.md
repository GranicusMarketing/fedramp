## Cloud Services & Security
•	Please list examples of contract language that you’ve encountered from Federal Agencies that positively incorporates cloud requirements and improves the availability and acquisition process of cloud products by the federal government.
o	Please also provide a succinct explanation supporting your assertion as to why your company views this contract language as a good example.
GRANICUS’ RESPONSE:
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services RFQ				
...the Contractor shall follow include:					 	
•	Must provide FedRamp accredited software that meets CMS’ requirements.
•	CMS requires FedRamp accredited cloud based software that is provided on a Software-as-a-Service (Saas) basis, is accessible to CMS staff on an enterprise wide basis and provides ongoing technological advancements throughout the contract lifecycle. Customers utilizing the service will include CMS staff and CMS contractors acting on CMS’s behalf. WNMG will serve as the broker between CMS customers that utilize the services provided and the contractor. 
This solicitation provides examples of FedRAMP being effectively incorporated into an SOW/solicitation in the federal space.
Positively incorporates cloud requirements:
•	“The Contractor shall implement the controls contained within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Baseline and FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Requirements for low and moderate impact system (as defined in FIPS 199).”
Comment: This is clear but leaves some ambiguity of the system requires a low or moderate FedRAMP baseline.
•	“CMS requires FedRamp accredited cloud based software that is provided on a Software-as-a-Service (Saas)”
Comment: This is a good acknowledgement and enabler that a CSP solution is required by the agency.
•	“In accordance with OMB policy, Federal agencies must use FedRAMP when authorizing cloud services. CMS Security Guidelines are publicly available at https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html.”
Comment: Few other contracts, if any, state that FedRAMP must be used.  This should be in all contracts. This is also a good example that an agency may have control requirements above the FedRAMP baseline that must be addressed.
•	Please list examples of contract language that you’ve encountered from Federal Agencies that negatively incorporates cloud requirements, and limits the availability and acquisition of cloud products by the federal government.
o	Please also provide a succinct explanation supporting your assertion as to why your company views this contract language as a bad example.

1.	Issued 01.06.2017
2.	Security Requirement: “7.0 Security. The Contractor shall implement security controls as appropriate for the system hosting solution.

1.	Outcome: In GAO Protest | Please note that because this is currently in GAO protest, information around the award decision should not be disclosed.  
These solicitations are perceived negatively because the FedRAMP requirement severity is reduced or not enforced by either the issuer - Department of Interior - or their end client, unnamed federal agencies.
Negatively incorporates cloud requirements:
•	“The solution must have Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) certification or Contractor must have submitted final materials for certification prior to start of service performance under this BPA.”
Comment: It is ambiguous that an award can be made based on the submission of materials without any qualification of the likelihood of the acceptance by FedRAMP. In such cases of a likely certification being obtained, it should be made clear that the certification will be received prior to the start of service production launch.
•	“The Contractor shall ensure that the solution is FedRAMP certified or that they have submitted final materials for certification prior to start of service performance under this BPA. The Contractor shall generally, substantially, and in good faith follow FedRAMP guidelines and Security guidance. In situations where there are no procedural guides, the Contractor shall use generally accepted industry best practices for IT security. All applicable elements of the FedRAMP Standard Contract Language document are hereby included by reference.”
Comment: There is some ambiguity as the contractor is told to follow “guidelines” which is less stringent than if it were to say, “…follow FedRAMP guidelines and Security guidance to assure that the required control statements within the appropriate level of FedRAMP baseline are met.”
•	“The Contractor shall ensure that the solution is compliant with all applicable Department of the Interior and Federal Information Technology guidance and regulations, including FedRAMP, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications.”
Comment: There is no mention about the OMB mandate.  Contractors could assume they are compliant with no award ramification if they are not.
•	In a Q&A document provided for a DOI RFQ, the question was raised: “…"the Contractor shall ensure that the solution is properly certified under FedRAMP;” however, Section C.3 states that the solution need only be, “properly certified for Federal services.” Question: Is the current minimum solution security certification required FedRAMP certification?”
Comment: It should be clear if having a FedRAMP authorization allows a service to be automatically ‘considered for Federal services”.
•	“Must provide FedRamp accredited software that meets CMS’ requirements.”
Comment: If we understand correctly, software is not “accredited” however, a SaaS solution can be “authorized”.  There is a continuous terminology inconsistency that could be addressed.  If contractors and agencies can get this straight and understand that an available SaaS solution must have a FedRAMP Agency or JAB authorization as mandated by OMB (or be on a realistic path to have one prior to a solution government solution going live), much of the contractual ambiguity could be minimized.
•	Please provide a suggestions for how to incorporate cloud into the procurement process in ways that would differ depending on whether the awardee is a (a) prime contract holder, (b) a reseller, (c) system integrators, or (d) some other type of contract that might be correctly or incorrectly covered in an agency solicitation.
o	As a note, this would likely include information related to responsible parties, ownership of information, and how vendors will engage with the government.
o	This also would be helpful to understand from a security / FedRAMP requirements perspective as well.
o	Please also provide a succinct explanation supporting your assertion as to why your company views this contract language as a good example.
GRANICUS’ RESPONSE:
The solicitations coming out of the Department of Interior did not denote the federal agency they were representing. If the FedRAMP solicitation requirements were to include naming the end user of the cloud service product, it would help FedRAMP and FedRAMP authorized CSPs better track the severity of the requirement and enforcement thereof across the federal marketplace. 


## FedRAMP PMO
•	Please list examples of contract language that you’ve encountered from Federal Agencies that positively incorporates FedRAMP and improves the availability and acquisition process of cloud products by the federal government.
o	As a note, we’re looking for ways that language appropriately conveys the partnership and level of effort related to obtaining a FedRAMP authorization through the security authorization process.
o	Please also provide a succinct explanation supporting your assertion as to why your company views this contract language as a good example.

•	Please provide a suggested written example of contract language that incorporates FedRAMP into the procurement process in the best possible way for a cloud service where market research demonstrates there is not a competitive range of similar vendors with existing FedRAMP authorizations.
o	As a note, since this grouping includes vendors that would need to obtain a FedRAMP authorization, we’re looking for ways that language appropriately conveys the partnership and level of effort related to obtaining a FedRAMP authorization through the security authorization process.
o	Please also provide a succinct explanation supporting your assertion as to why your company views this contract language as a good example.
	GRANICUS’ RESPONSE
Limited competition environment
•	“The Contractor shall ensure that the solution is properly certified under FedRAMP or that they have submitted final materials for certification prior to start of service performance under this BPA. The Contractor shall generally, substantially, and in good faith follow federally established guidelines and security practices. In situations where there are no procedural guides, the Contractor shall use generally accepted industry best practices for IT security. In case of a cloud-hosted solution, all applicable elements of the FedRAMP Standard Contract Language document are hereby included by reference.”
Comment: “properly certified” assumes the reader know what is required. It should instead state that a low or moderate FedRAMP P-ATO authorization or agency authorization is required as mandated by the OMB. Having “submitted” prior to start of service is ambiguous.  Certainly, that FedRAMP authorization process can start ahead of obtaining an agency or JAB FedRAMP authorization, but the “activation” of a live production service should require that the authorization including continuous monitoring and all associated required controls and processes be in place.
•	Please list examples of contract language that you’ve encountered from Federal Agencies that negatively incorporates various specific security requirements that relate to FedRAMP (e.g., encryption, background investigations) or additional non-FedRAMP related security requirements (such as availability SLAs, data location) and limits the availability and acquisition process of cloud products by the federal government.
o	Please also provide a succinct explanation supporting your assertion as to why your company views this contract language as a bad example.
GRANICUS’ RESPONSE:
Specific requirements: hurts
•	“Security: The Contractor shall host the digital communications management system in an environment with redundant connectivity and appropriate physical and electronic back-up systems. The Contractor shall establish practices for protection of any connections between agency websites and the digital communications management system consistent with Federal guidance and regulations.”
Comment: This only lists requirements for two controls and essentially skips that other vs the +100 to +200 controls for a low or moderate FedRAMP authorization. Agencies should be aware of the full range of baseline controls and call them out specifically or use a FedRAMP baseline.  Ideally, contractors should know the FIPS 199 Security Impact Level and state it as a requirement.
•	“The solution must have Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRamp) certification or have submitted final materials for certification and must be a responsive design.”
Comment: This is another example of an ambiguous requirement as materials can be submitted yet may take months to years to be acceptable.
